# My first NuGet package: Startwatch

Upon noticing that I wanted to use the same `Stopwatch` wrapper class in two separate C# solutions, I thought it might be worth creating my first NuGet package and using that instead. (NuGet is the package manager for the .NET ecosystem.)

A bit later, I'd created [CodeConscious.Startwatch at Nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/packages/CodeConscious.Startwatch). It's a ridiculously tiny library only intended to format elapsed `Stopwatch` times into my preferred string formats, but I've incorporated it into the two aforementioned solutions successfully, and I'm pretty satisfied with it.

More importantly, I've lowered the barrier to my next NuGet package, whatever (and whenever) that might be!
