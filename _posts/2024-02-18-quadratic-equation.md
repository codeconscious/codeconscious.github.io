# Quadratic equation in multiple languages

A friend of mine who's taking a programming course shared one of her homework problems with me. It's a simple one involving quadratic equations meant to introduce learners things like switch statements and such. However, I found it a nice small exercise for my F# studies (since I seem to be a bit fixated on F# these days...).

Ultimately, I implemented it in C#, F#, and Rust. To be fair, I relied on my friend's excellent Java implementation to understand the core logic since I haven't thought about quadratic equations in some time.

It was enjoyable, and I might do more such exercises in the future, particularly for F# and Rust, both of which I'm interested in learning more about.
