# One Year of F#

It’s already been about a year since I started learning F#. Perhaps a small update is in order.

I think it’s fair to say that F# and the functional programming (FP) paradigm have rejuvenated my passion for programming. The relative elegance, clarity, and power of FP are refreshing and fascinating, and it’s immensely satisfying to write FP code. I never would have expected F# to take my “favorite language” crown from C#, but it has.

I think many people (including me in the recent past) assume that FP has a much higher barrier to entry than it has. Of course, there are some new (and interesting!) things to learn, but I’ve found that just diving in and learning concepts as I go is sufficient to get started, be productive, and have fun.

What’s next? I’ve also dug into Haskell and OCaml a little too. F# is great, but I’d like to know more about those languages’ more powerful type systems too. I’m still unsure which, if either, I'll continue with, though.

My opinion: Every software engineer should spend at least _some_ time with a functional-first FP language. (I think F# is a good first FP language for all, but it's a no-brainer if you’re already a .NET engineer.) Whether you end up liking or disliking FP languages, I feel confident you’ll think about programming at least a bit differently, obtain a deeper understanding of the functional tools that your favorite language probably already provides, and come away a better (or at least more well-rounded) software engineer. At least, I feel that's been my experience thus far.
