# Ruby Script: Convert Text to Slack Emoji

Wanting a quick bit of Ruby practice, I took some free time to create a Ruby script that converts a given string to alphanumeric Slack emoji of one of several styles. (It requires that your Slack instance contain the emoji referenced.)

I expressly aimed to incorporate lambda functions. That's from a desire to know them better, of course, but I also feel some influence from my recent experiences with F#.

Recently, I feel like I'm enjoying Ruby more and seeing its strengths. It's definitely a nice scripting language, at the least.
