# Ruby Script: Convert Text to Slack Emoji

Wanting a quick bit of Ruby practice, I took a bit of free time to create a Ruby script that converts a given string to alphanumeric emoji of one of several styles.

I expressly aimed to incorporate lambda functions. That's from a desire to know them better, of course, but I also feel some influence from my recent experiences with F#.

Recently, I feel like I'm enjoying Ruby more and seeing its strengths. It's definitely nice scripting language, at the least.
