# Another happy stakeholder!

> Thank you very much!!! Checked the demo video and page on staging and it looks perfect! Please kindly release it!

My latest feature was relatively small, but I nailed the technical implementation and delivered just what the stakeholder wanted. It's always nice to have a happy user. ^_^

I also introduced a couple of new processes for such projects:
1. easy-to-read project summaries and up-to-date status messages in features' Slack channels (which my team has already adopted, it seems!)
2. recorded video demos with narration (for obtaining stakeholder approval)

In particular, creating a recorded video demo helped me with QA, and it also eliminated the need for a dedicated demo meeting, saving everyone's time, avoiding risk of issues during an online meeting (e.g., bad connections), and allowing for much quicker stakeholder signoff. I always felt a more async process there would be beneficial, so I'm glad my initial experiment was successful.

Incidentally, I used [OpenShot Video Editor](https://www.openshot.org) for the recorded demo. It's free, open-source, and cross-platform, and it worked very well for my purposes.
