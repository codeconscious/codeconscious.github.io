# Android File Transfer on macOS Sequoia

Since upgrading my Apple M1 Pro to [Sequoia](https://www.apple.com/jp/macos/macos-sequoia/), I find that Android File Transfer (version 1.0.12) sometimes does not register my clicks to return to the parent folder for several seconds. This has made browsing my Android phone with it much slowerâ€”a minor but persistant annoyance.

However, a PSA: The keyboard shortcut Command-Up is equivalent and does not have this delay.

I'm not even sure this application is being updated, so it might be time to look into alternatives anyway.
