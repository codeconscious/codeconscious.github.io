# Jumping Into GitHub Actions

At work, I was recently asked to create a couple of small workflows in GitHub.

I had never created such workflows before, but after watching a PluralSight course (Aaron Stewart's "[Getting Started with GitHub Actions](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/github-actions-getting-started/table-of-contents)," for those interested) to get a good overview, and while doing further research and troubleshooting as I worked, I successfully created the new workflows.

It was more interesting than I'd expected!

Me being me, I jumped right into adding simple build-and-test workflows into several of my personal projects here on GitHub (such as [CCVTAC](https://github.com/codeconscious/ccvtac/pull/40)). It definitely felt like a "Why haven't I done this before?" sort of task.

Next, I might like to use GitHub Actions to set up automatic releases for my primary .NET projects. Perhaps I'll also set up automatic deploys of [StartWatch](https://codeconscious.github.io/2024/01/08/first-nuget-package.html) to NuGet as well. ðŸ¤”
