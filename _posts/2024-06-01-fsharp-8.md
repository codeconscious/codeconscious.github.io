# F# 8's `_.Property` shorthand

Since I've jumped into F# recently, I thought I'd review [the F# 8 release notes](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-fsharp-8/) from last year to see what the newest features I should be aware of were. There were several!

The one that immediately stood out to me was "[_.Property shorthand for (fun x -> x.Property)](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-fsharp-8/#_-property-shorthand-for-fun-x-x-property)", and I immediately looked for a way to incorporate it into code I'd written. Ultimately, I just [updated a single script](https://github.com/codeconscious/scripts/commit/7eef4d7b4fb551b6518d4103ca60d196e2eb071b), but it indeed resulted in slightly shorter and more legible (I'd say) code.
