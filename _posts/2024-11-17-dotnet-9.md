# .NET 9

[.NET 9 was announced](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-dotnet-9/) recently, and as usual, [there are many improvements](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/whats-new/dotnet-9/overview#c-13), including [C# 13](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-13) and [F# 9](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/whats-new/fsharp-9).

I spent a bit of time upgrading [CCVTAC](https://github.com/codeconscious/ccvtac/pull/72) and [AudioTagger](https://github.com/codeconscious/audiotagger/pull/88) to .NET 9 this morning. As usual, there were no problems. (I did run into an apparent [false-positive error bug in Rider](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/RIDER-91794), which [I've recently begun using](https://codeconscious.github.io/2024/10/26/jetbrains-rider.html), but it was ignorable.)

I used Rider to upgrade all of my NuGet packages to their latest versions as well, which was quite convenient. During this process, I learned about [`dotnet nuget why`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-nuget-why), which displays the dependency graph for a particular package. For example, here's my output for CCVTAC when I ran it for System.Net.Http:

```
Project 'CCVTAC.Console' does not have a dependency on 'System.Net.Http'.
Project 'CCVTAC.Console.Tests' has the following dependency graph(s) for 'System.Net.Http':

  [net9.0]
   │  
   └─ xunit (v2.4.2)
      ├─ xunit.assert (v2.4.2)
      │  └─ NETStandard.Library (v1.6.1)
      │     └─ System.Net.Http (v4.3.0)
      └─ xunit.core (v2.4.2)
         ├─ xunit.extensibility.core (v2.4.2)
         │  └─ NETStandard.Library (v1.6.1)
         │     └─ System.Net.Http (v4.3.0)
         └─ xunit.extensibility.execution (v2.4.2)
            ├─ NETStandard.Library (v1.6.1)
            │  └─ System.Net.Http (v4.3.0)
            └─ xunit.extensibility.core (v2.4.2)
               └─ NETStandard.Library (v1.6.1)
                  └─ System.Net.Http (v4.3.0)

Project 'CCVTAC.FSharp' does not have a dependency on 'System.Net.Http'.
Project 'CCVTAC.FSharp.Tests' does not have a dependency on 'System.Net.Http'.
```

Looking more at that site, there are several more `dotnet` commands than I was aware of. Good to know!
