# Improved processes and another happy stakeholder

> Thank you very much!!! Checked the demo video and page on staging and it looks perfect! Please kindly release it!

My latest feature was relatively small, but I nailed the technical implementation and delivered just what the stakeholder wanted. It's always nice to have happy users.

I also introduced a couple of new processes for such projects:

1. easy-to-read project summaries and up-to-date status messages in features' Slack channels (which already seems popular with other engineers ðŸ˜Ž)
2. prerecorded video demos with narration (for obtaining stakeholder approval)

In particular, creating a prerecorded video demo had several benefits:

1. helping with final QA checks; and
2. eliminating the need for a dedicated demo meeting with stakeholders, thus:
    1. saving everyone's time, since stakeholders could view and share the video at their convenience;
    2. avoiding the risk of issues during an online meeting (e.g., bad connections); and
    3. allowing for much quicker stakeholder signoff.


I always felt a more asynchronous process there would be beneficial, so I'm glad my initial experiment was successful.

Incidentally, I used [OpenShot Video Editor](https://www.openshot.org) for the prerecorded demo. It's free, open-source, and cross-platform, and it worked very well for my purposes. This time, I recorded the video and audio separately and then combined them in OpenShot, but I hope to streamline the process soon.
