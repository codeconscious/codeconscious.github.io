# F# "enquoten" script

As part of my F# studies, I created a script that processes text files by (1) truncating lines to a specified maximum length and (2) prepending `> ` to the beginning of lines, thereby quoting them as in plain text emails.

I'm still tinkering with it, but it has been a suprisingly good little exercise. I'm sure it can be done much better (and probably even as a crazy bash one-liner ðŸ˜„), but I'm pretty pleased with it.

In particular, I had the idea to create a tool like this when I realized that it was a perfect chance for practicing tail-recursive functions.
