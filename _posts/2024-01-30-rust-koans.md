# Rust koans

I completed the Rust koans that [I mentioned beginning the other day](https://codeconscious.github.io/2024/01/28/rust-koans-in-vs-code.html). They weren't as robust and well put together as [the Ruby koans](https://codeconscious.github.io/2024/01/08/ruby-koans.html) that I completed earlier this month, but it was enjoyable and useful.

Rust remains an attractive language and, after completing [the F# koans](https://codeconscious.github.io/2024/01/25/fsharp-koans.html) the other day too, I'm feeling more like Rust really hits some of sweet spots of both functional and imperative languages. In any case, I want to pick it up more again.
