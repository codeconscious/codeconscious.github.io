# Omnivore extension for Firefox

Recently, I've been trying out [Omnivore](https://omnivore.app/) as a potential replacement for [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/en/) as my read-it-later application. I installed its Firefox extension, but each time I attempted saving an article, I'd see the following error:

> You have not granted the Omnivore extension consent to save pages.
> Check the extension options page to grant consent.

I was initially unable to locate that setting, but I found the answer in [an entry on the blog Ruminations on Technology](https://www.sacredchaos.com/rants/ruminations_technology/2023/december.html#1):

> [T]he fix is to right-click on the extension icon, select "Manage Extension", then click on the three dots, select "Preferences" and, finally, scroll down to the bottom of the page, and check the box for "I consent to data collection".

This immediately resolved the issue for me.
