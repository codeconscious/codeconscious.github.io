# C# Type Unions Proposal

Microsoft has published their proposal for discriminated unions in C#: [Type Unions for C#](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/blob/18a527bcc1f0bdaf542d8b9a189c50068615b439/proposals/TypeUnions.md).

This is just the first public step in a long line of steps necessary to add DUs, but I'm definitely looking forward to having DUs and exhaustive pattern matching (at least in the context of DUs) in C# someday.

Here are some discussions on the topic as well:

- [r/programming](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1ef7fd7/official_type_unions_proposal_by_the_c_language/)
