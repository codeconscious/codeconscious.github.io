# VS Code: Jumping to line numbers

Did you know that, in Visual Studio Code, you can jump directly to a specific line number using the keyboard?

1. Press _Command–P_ (I presume _Ctrl-P_ works similarly)
2. Enter the line number preceded by a colon — for example, `:228`
3. Press the Enter Key

I learned this nice one from a workmate a while back. 👍
