# Ruby script for batch audio conversion

I had reason to convert a batch of MP3 files to M4A. (Normally I wouldn't do such lossy-to-lossy conversions, but I did in this case.) To simplify the process, I created a small Ruby script to automate the process:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/codeconscious/6303eabac07bc29116b1a36a316f95f1.js"></script>

To be fair, I'm pretty sure I could have done this in a single-use terminal one-liner, but it was a nice little after-work exercise and might prove helpful again.
