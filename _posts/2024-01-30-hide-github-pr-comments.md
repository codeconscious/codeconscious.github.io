# Bookmarklet: Toggle GitHub PR comment visibility

While reviewing a colleague's pull request on GitHub today, I encountered a long, unresolved comment chain that occupied a large chunk of space between two related lines of text. The comments made it more difficult to follow the code, so I took the opportunity to create a bookmarklet that toggles the visibility of all discussions on the page:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/codeconscious/6659b224b7ee6b9d2fcfdf17d37c68e3.js"></script>

Having the comments hidden definitely makes for a more comfortable PR review.
