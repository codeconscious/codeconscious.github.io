# Resolving intermittent Android File Transfer connection failures on macOS

Android File Transfer on my M1 MacBook Pro sometimes becomes unable to access the files on my Android smartphone for no discernable reason.

Long story short: If this happens to you, close the Preview app.

I have no idea why, but once Preview is closed, Android File Transfer can instantly access my smartphone files again. ðŸ¤·
